# mutcount2024

This repo host the code to quantify exact match count for Phosphosite Scanning sequencing data developed by Jennifer Benanti lab.

- The code in AE_type folder is older, but it was the exact code used to reproduce the results for AE type

- The code in WA_WE_type folder is newer, and it can be used to reproduce the results for WA_WE type

Under each folder, a readme file can be found that shows how to run the code on the example data
